Three person scene with two people in the scene, the third off to the side as "Doug."
Get a suggestion for a location and an emotion for Doug.
Doug is off to the side and doesn't talk, but his emotion is influenced by the other two people.
Doug is in the same scene location, but off to the side but not directly interacting with the main scene players.
Escalation of the emotions and relationships is important.
Non-confrontational interactions preferred.
Doug isn't connected to the other two scene players, but instead is building his emotional involvement proportional to the escalation of the primary scene players.
