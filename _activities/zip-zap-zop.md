{{ site.data.components["Circle Up"] }}
Ask the group to repeat the words "Zip, Zap, Zop" three or four times, all together.
Introduce the activity: Imagine that I have a bolt of energy in my hands.
To start the game, I will send the bolt out of energy out of my body with a strong forward motion straight to someone else in the circle (use hands, body, eyes, and voice to make contact across the circle) and say, "Zip."
Explain that the next person takes the energy and passes it immediately to someone else saying "Zap."
That person passes it on to another participant with a "Zop."
The game continues and the "Zip, Zap, Zop" sequence is repeated as the energy moves around the circle.  

Encourage all players to use their whole body to send energy and to make eye contact.
They can send the energy to whomever they want but the goal is to include all players. Practice the game.
If there is a mistake, encourage players to simply resume playing without discussion.
The group challenge is to go very quickly and stay consistent in rhythm; if players struggle, pause the game, discuss strategy and try again.
