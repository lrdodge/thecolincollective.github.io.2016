Everyone will be clapping in rhythm with your neighbor's hands as well as your own, fairly slow at first but after each full round increase the speed.

    Czechoslovakia, boom chicka boom.
    Yugoslavia, boom chicka boom.
    Let's get the rhythm of the hands.
    *clap clap clap*
    We've got the rhythm of the hands.
    *clap clap clap*
    Let's get the rhythm of the feet.
    *stomp stomp stomp*
    We've got the rhythm of the feet.
    *stomp stomp stomp*
    Let's get the rhythm of the eyes.
    WOOOOO!!!
    We've got the rhythm of the eyes.
    WOOOOO!!!
    Let's get the rhythm of the numbers.
    Two Three Four
    We've got the rhythm of the numbers.
    Two Three Four

Repeat.
The counting after rhythm of the numbers is faster, at the rate the next round will be set at.
Keep repeating until total chaos engulfs the group.
