One person is given three suggestions (in order):

1. Name
2. Adjective
3. Occupation

The person then gives a monologue as the character created by the suggestions.
Ask the character up to three questions which explore their point of view.
After questions have been asked, someone steps in for a short scene with that character.
Repeat until everyone has given a monologue at least once.
