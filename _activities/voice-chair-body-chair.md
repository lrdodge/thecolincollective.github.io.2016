Two person scene with both people sitting in chairs.
The person in the right chair and starts with a character whose voice is inspired by a suggestion.
The person in the left chair starts with a character inspired by a body position.
People rotate through and take turns filling in for the characters (depending on which chair they sit in) as questions are asked in the style of an interview.
