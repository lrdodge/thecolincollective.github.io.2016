Two person scenes beginning with a suggestion.
The start of every sentence must begin with either "I", "You", or "We."
One person watches and informs the players when he/she feels the relationship has been established.
Only once the relationship has been established can other words be used to start sentences.
Continue until everyone has watched once.
