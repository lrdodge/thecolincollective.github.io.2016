Everyone off to the sides except for one person who is watching.
The one person watching will give a suggestion of a location and silently count off five seconds.
As soon as the location is given, players immediately and without hesitation walk on stage.
As players are walking they will create a character to fill a role in the location.
Each player's interaction with the environment and dialogue with other characters should inform others of their chosen role.
Object-work should be sufficient to establish your role in the environment, but feel free to interact with other characters as you would in a regular scene.

Don't try to make a different choice than another player.
No choice is a bad choice; thinking is not required.
Having multiple people make the same choice can create wonderful scenes when justified of expanded upon.
Once the five seconds have elapsed the person watching calls for people to stop.
The watcher then attempts to guess the roles of the characters in the scene.
Rotate through until everyone has been the watcher at least once.
