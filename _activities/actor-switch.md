Two person scenes where one starts with high status and the other with low status.
Examples would be doctor/patient or principal/student.
Any relationship will work as long as the status is distinct.
Initial status is set before the scene begins and should remain throughout the scene.
Players perform a short scene with the relationship and status given to them.
Players then replay the scene exactly as before, but change the status of the characters around.
