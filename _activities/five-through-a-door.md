Start with a suggestion for a type of store.
Start a two person transaction scene with the clerk working in the store as the straight-man.
The other person comes in through the door as a character with a strong emotion.
The door character and clerk should know each other.
The twist here is the emotion is random and only given just before the person walks through the door.
By giving the random emotion at the last moment there is no time to plan.
Short scenes between the two until the customer finds a reason to leave.
Once the person leaves, they immediately receive a new emotion and must walk back through the door as a new character with a new emotion.
Emotions are random and instant.
The challenge is to make the scene non-transactional.
