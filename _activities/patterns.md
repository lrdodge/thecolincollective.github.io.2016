{{ site.data.components["Circle Up"] }}
Start by creating a set of linked identifiers following a theme (e.g. numbers, colors, animals, etc.).
To do this, point at a person who hasn't been pointed at yet and say something in line with the theme which has been created.
The theme can either be stated ahead of time or created organically.
For example, the first person says "cat," the second person says "dog," the third person says "fish," etc. with the established pattern being pets created by the second choice of "dog."

Speed is not the objective.
Taking care of your scene partner should be a priority over speed.
Execute as quickly as possible without sacrificing communication.
That being said, try to push yourselves and see how fast you can go before everything breaks down.

### Extend: Where the F--- is the Celery
Create two or more patterns (suggested: three) until everyone feels comfortable with each linked set.
Next, start sending the identifiers around the circle at the same time.
Once everyone is comfortable with the simultaneous identifiers, start moving to the next person in the chain when you're activated.
