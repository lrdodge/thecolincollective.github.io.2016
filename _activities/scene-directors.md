Group splits into equal parts On and equal parts Off.
Each person Off chooses a person On to watch during the exercise.
The people On rotate through two person scenes until roughly half the possible combinations have been completed.
The people Off then give a challenge to the person On they were watching which the person On will have to complete during the second part of the exercise.
A different set of two person scenes is then performed while embracing those challenges.
Once a roughly half the possible combinations have been completed the groups switch and repeat the exercise.
