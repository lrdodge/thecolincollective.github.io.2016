Two person scene where one person initiates the scene and the second person mimics the actions and voice of the person who initiated.
Then the scene progresses with the chameleon duplicating the type of character the other is doing.
This includes the opinions and world views.
Everything!

Rotate through until everyone has been the initaitor and the chameleon at least once.
