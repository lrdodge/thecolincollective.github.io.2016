Two person scene starts with the following sequence steps:

1. Person #1 starts the scene with an action/activity.
2. Person #1 does not talk until Person #2 has spoken.
3. Person #2 comes on and joins Person #1 in the environment created by their actions.
4. Person #2 should be complimenting the actions of Person #1, heightening as well.
5. Person #2 then says something about what they observe about Person #1.
6. Person #1 then says something about what they observe about Person #2.

The scene continues focusing on these relationships.
Rotate through until everyone has been both Person #1 and Person #2 at least once.

Be sure to give these scenes time to breathe.
It's not uncommon for these scenes to last five minutes or more.
If the scene hasn't found a nature close we'll cut at around ten minutes for the sake of time.
