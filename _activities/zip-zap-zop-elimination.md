Split into two or more groups (three to four people per group recommended) with one person waiting on the outside of the groups.
Within each group play [Zip Zap Zop](../zip-zap-zop/) as fast as possible at all times.
Whenever a mistake is made or there is a pause, that person is eliminated and switches with the person on the outside.
