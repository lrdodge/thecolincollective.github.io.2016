Three to five people sit in a line of chairs with the lights off and their eyes closed.
The name of a town is chosen by suggestion.
These people will be playing a set of dead people who used to live in the town.
Three rounds (see below) going down the line as each person describes, the more details the better, a particular aspect of their character.

1. Name and occupation in the town
2. Relationship with another person in the line
3. How did you die?
