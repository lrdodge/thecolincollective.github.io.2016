Extension of Patterns.

{{ site.data.components["Circle Up"] }}
Start by creating a set of linked identifiers following a theme.
To do this, point at a person who hasn't been pointed at yet and say something in line with the theme which has been created.
The theme can either be stated ahead of time (i.e. numbers) or created organically.
For example, the first person says "cat," the second person says "dog," the third person says "fish," etc. with the established pattern being pets created by the second choice of "dog."

Create two or more patterns (suggested: three) until everyone feels comfortable with each linked set.
Next, start sending the identifiers around the circle at the same time.
Once everyone is comfortable with the simultaneous identifiers, start moving to the next person in the chain when you're activated.
