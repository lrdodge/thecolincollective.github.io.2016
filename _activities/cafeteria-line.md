Players form into a single line.
Optionally, a suggestion of a type of restaurant can be given.
First player will create a character to go through a cafeteria line and order food.
At the start of the cafeteria line, the character will make a comment through their point of view.
The comment will likely be about how the character is feeling or thinking.
The character then orders three normal, every-day food items (in order) as he/she moves down the cafeteria line:

1. Drink
2. Entr√©e
3. Dessert

Some detail is helpful, but don't overdo it.
As the character receives the food at the end of the line, he/she turns and makes a non-sequitur to the next person in line.
Each player after the first will recreate the initial character and make the same choices, but heightened.
Even the initial comment and non-sequitur should be heightened.
Continue until each player has gone through the cafeteria line.

Don't forget object-work.
Be sure not to heighten too fast or the rest of the players will have no where to go.
It's not a race to the top; think baby steps.
