Splint into two or more groups (three to four people per group recommended) with one person waiting on the outside of the groups.
Within each group play Play Zip Zap Zop as fast as possible at all times.
Whenever a mistake is made or there is a pause, that person is eliminated and switches with the person on the outside.
