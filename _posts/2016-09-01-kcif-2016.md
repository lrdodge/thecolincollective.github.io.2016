It's been a long and tiring two weeks, but we're sad KCIF 2016 has ended.
With thirty-five troupes performing over six days we more than had our fill of wonderful and talented improv.
And that's not even counting the workshops and after-parties (karaoke!) we managed to cram into the time between shows.

Given the impossible challenge of using only a single sentence to condense our complicate feelings, we'd like to share a few of our reactions as we look back on the festival weeks.
We had such a fun time performing this year and cannot wait to return for next year's festival.
If you missed our show you can check it out below.
Enjoy!
