The Colin Collective has been selected to perform at the 2016 Kansas City Improv Festival! We are excited to present our latest format “The Rope.” In each scene, one character (presumably the most interesting one) leaves the scene and we follow him or her to the next location. Worlds blend, meld, and collide, building and fleshing out a beautifully crafted and three dimensional imaginary universe.

Our show will be 7:00 PM at the Kick Comedy Theater located at 4010 Pennsylvania Ave, Kansas City, MO 64111. You will be able to see all kinds of great info as it is released at the [festival website](http://www.kcimprovfestival.com) and the [public Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kcimprovfest). They will be posting the schedule, group bios, workshop info, ticketing, and more as it becomes available.
