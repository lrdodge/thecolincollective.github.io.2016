While we were only there a single weekend, we've fallen in love with Denver.
Begging to be explored, we didn't even begin to scratch the surface during our time there.
Some of our favorite memories include:

* Alice almost getting attacked by an emu with Mish, Adam, and Gabi at the zoo.
* Casey loved our practice set with Luke's third wheel character.
* Performing in the middle of an actual brewery!
* Kelly caught this moment before the show. We were all together and having silly fun!

We had the opportunity of opening for the wonderful [Here, the Musical](http://taraandrance.com/) and share the same stage with Carla and Craig Cackowski of Orange Tuxedo.
It was such a great time we are already looking forward to next year's festival.
If you were not able to see us in Denver, don't be sad!
You still have a chance to see our performance.
Enjoy!
