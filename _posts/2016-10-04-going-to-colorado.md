Famous for their omelets and an [airport full of conspiracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_International_Airport#Conspiracies_and_controversy), the Mile High City is also host to the Denver Improv Festival (DIF).
The Colin Collective is thrilled to announce we'll be performing in Denver on Saturday, 12 Nov 2016 during the 7:00 PM show at Backstage at Berylâ€™s.

An annual improv comedy festival held in downtown Denver, DIF showcases the best improvisers and teachers from Colorado and all over the United States.
You can find more DIF information at [www.denverimprovfestival.com](http://www.denverimprovfestival.com/index.php/landing-page/) or their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/denverimprovfestival/).
