One random day in the spring of 2015, a bunch of people sat down together for beers, and when they stood up again they had become The Colin Collective.
Based out of Kansas City, The Colin Collective has been playing primarily in long form.

The Colin Collective has a wide spectrum of backgrounds, from acting to software development to juggling to transportation logistics.
Most are involved in additional improv groups, including Comedy City, the Kansas City Improv Company, Babies, and That’s No Movie while performing at events such as Planet ComicCon and the Chicago Improv Festival.
Several members of the troupe are werewolves, but this won’t become clear until several people in the audience have mysteriously disappeared.

With over thirty years of combined experience, The Colin Collective is dedicated to providing an online educational resource for both new and experienced improvisers.
They have also been contracted by DARPA to develop advanced humor-based weaponry for the ongoing War on Seriousness.
