Circle Up: Players to stand in a circle with the order randomized using whatever method you prefer.
Form Two Lines: Players form two lines of equal length. Mix it up so players are not across from someone they've done senes with already.
Switch Lines: Players switch lines when he/she has completed a scene. Continue until every player has completed a scene from both lines.
Rotate Through: Form a single, randomized line where the first players in line start the first scene. Players rotate through each scene role until every player has performed a scene as each role. Will result in back-to-back scenes except for the first player who rotates out and will be in the last scene. For example, Player 1 starts as Role B and Player 2 starts as Role A. The next scene will be Player 2 as Role A, Player 3 as Role B, and Player 1 at the back of the line.
